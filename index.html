                <p>i'm toople. you can also call me starlight, or null (for sql's sake, please don't!)</p>

                <h3>what are you?</h3>
                <p>a magical cat spirit made out of hopes and dreams, who fell down from the starry skies.</p>

                <h3>what do you do?</h3>
                <p>
                    i love to draw cutesy, pastel-colored things. i do work with different art styles sometimes,
                    but that's another story!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    on the other hand, i make small websites with little to no javascript (believe it or not,
                    it improves speed!), i daydream fantasy worlds a lot.
                </p>
                <h3>how many languages/libraries/frameworks do you know?</h3>
                <p>
                    um, if i count from my early school days, i know a decent amount of python. i mostly work
                    with html and css, and i know basic javascript. so far, aside from the python standard
                    libraries, i know not much libraries and frameworks.
